# TextReplacement
Text replacement script to make life easier when entering the same information repetitively.

Some key points about the text replacements:
- All replacement keys must begin with a forward slash '/'.
- A replacement will only take place after hitting the spacebar and a key has been matched.
- <strike>In order to allow replacements to flow over multiple lines, use the newline character '\n'
  (eg. 'First Line\nSecond Line' will produce 'First Line' then move to the next line and produce 'Second Line')</strike>
  (Multiple line input is now supported without any work around necessary)
